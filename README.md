Hi I'm Shah and this is my first attempt to create my portfolio site using ChatGPT-4 and implementing Tailwind CSS.
I already learnt about HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. I also managed to create a clone of a Youtube page using HTML & CSS by following a tutorial from SuperSimpleDev on Youtube. Shout-out to Simon for his awesome tutorial!!
Now, I want to test my skill by creating my portfolio site but somehow I'm quite lost and felt overwhelm. Lol.
I also quite curious to learn about Bootstrap & Tailwind CSS but it causing me to feel more overwhelm because there are so many things to learn about those and I want to avoid from getting stuck on watching tutorials.
So I decided to explore a bit about Tailwind CSS because I think it is much easier to learn compare to Bootstrap and Tailwind also have a documentation about all the class with different style which is very convenient & helpful.
Instead of watching the whole tutorial about Tailwind, I tried to start creating a project using Tailwind with help from ChatGPT.
My first objective is to LEARN by creating my first website.
So, I used ChatGPT to code the main structure and I tried to edit the code to get what I want while trying to understand what's going on at every lines of the code.
I also tried to tweak some of the codes to get a better understanding.

So, here is my first project!
